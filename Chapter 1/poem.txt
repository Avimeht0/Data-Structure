Ode to DawnIn hues of pearl, the darkness fades,A gentle breath, 
the world pervades.The eastern sky, a canvas bright,
Awakes to kiss the fading night.A hush descends, 
the shadows flee,As golden light sets spirits free.
The birdsong swells, a chorus clear,Announcing day, 
and banishing fear.The dewdrops cling, like diamonds strewn,
Reflecting skies, a silver moon.The world reborn, 
in vibrant grace,A tranquil smile on nature's face.Oh,
 dawn, sweet dawn, a promise made,Of hope and dreams that will not fade.
 A time to rise, and greet the day,And find our path along the way.
